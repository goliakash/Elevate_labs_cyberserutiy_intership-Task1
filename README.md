Tool: Nmap 7.95 (nmap -sS)

Scope: 256 IP addresses scanned, 4 active hosts detected.

Contents
Scan Screenshot: Example output from the terminal.

PDF Report: Detailed explanation of discovered open ports, associated security risks, and mitigations.

Key Findings
Several hosts exposed common service ports (FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP, SMB).

Each open port was analyzed for risks and mitigation strategies provided.

Example of good security hygiene observedâ€”some hosts had all ports closed.

Usage
Review the PDF for a summary of security risks and suggested actions based on detected open ports.
